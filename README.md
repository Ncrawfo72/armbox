# robot arm
For this project we had to create a robot arm that could pick up and move an object. Chris and nixon created a box with robot arm that would pick up a small ball and drop it into a container that would eventualy shoot it out. Our first challenge was design which we solved by our proof of concept box, then the actual creation took over in import.

the code for the project was relatively simple as all we needed to do was have two servos fire with one click of a button. Very complex stuff for me and nixon but we were smart enough to ask for help. Huge thanks to Graham Gilbert-schroeer for a lot of help with the code. the code is as follows.
