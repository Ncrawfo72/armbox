# robot arm
For this project we had to create a robot arm that could pick up and move an object. Chris and nixon created a box with robot arm that would pick up a small ball and drop it into a container that would eventualy shoot it out. Our first challenge was design which we solved by our proof of concept box, then the actual creation took over in import.
